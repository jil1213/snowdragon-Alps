This github repository will hopefully soon be a package that can be used for automatic snow grain classification and layer segmentation of Snow Micro Pen (SMP) Profiles.

Currently, this is work in progress. More information, explanations etc. will be given soon.

## Background and Methods
For more information about the SMP, look here: [SLF Website](https://www.slf.ch/en/ueber-das-slf/versuchsanlagen-und-labors/kaeltelabor/snowmicropenr.html)

I am using different Machine Learning models for the classification part.

## Requirements
