# separate between tuning and models and runner (for the moment just put tuning in another module)

# import all the models
# import the parameters from the tuning_parameters file

# all based on balanced accuracy

# TODO: all scikit learn models must be able to return only the model!

# GridSearch for all the models from scikitlearn

# in theory grid search is also possible for keras models: https://www.kaggle.com/shujunge/gridsearchcv-with-keras
# model = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_model)

# for loops for anns

# for loops for custom models
